So why did I write this book? I wrote it because life for teens is no playground. It’s a
jungle out there. And if I’ve done my job right, this book can be like a compass to help you
navigate through it. Unlike my dad’s book, which was written for old people (and can get
really boring at times), this book was written especially for teens and is always interesting.
